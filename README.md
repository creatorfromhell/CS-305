**Client Summary and Requirements**

Artemis Financial, a consulting firm that specializes in individualized financial planning, requested assistance in modernizing its software operations to enhance security. Their public web application needed additional safeguards to protect sensitive client data and financial information, especially during data transfers. Specifically, they sought a file verification process using a checksum as an extra security measure to ensure data integrity in their communications.

**Identifying and Addressing Software Security Vulnerabilities**

In assessing Artemis Financial’s software, I identified areas where security protocols could be strengthened, particularly in data verification and secure communication channels. By thoroughly analyzing potential vulnerabilities, I implemented secure coding practices that focused on preventing unauthorized data access and manipulation. Coding securely is essential to guard against cyber threats, protect sensitive information, and maintain client trust, which in turn strengthens a company’s credibility and operational resilience.

**Challenges and Insights in Vulnerability Assessment**

The vulnerability assessment posed challenges in identifying all potential security flaws within the web application. It was particularly helpful to use automated vulnerability scanning tools to pinpoint high-risk areas, which guided the prioritization of specific security enhancements. This experience underscored the importance of both manual and automated assessments to cover a range of security risks effectively.

**Enhancing Security Layers**

To increase layers of security, I incorporated encryption for data transmission, implemented secure authentication protocols, and added a checksum verification step to validate file integrity during transfers. In the future, I would use comprehensive security frameworks and conduct regular penetration testing to assess vulnerabilities and select appropriate mitigation strategies.

**Ensuring Code and Application Functionality**

After refactoring the code, I performed rigorous testing to verify the software's functionality and security, focusing on confirming that each update maintained system stability and reliability. To check for any new vulnerabilities, I conducted regression testing and re-ran vulnerability scans to ensure no additional security risks were introduced.

**Resources, Tools, and Practices for Future Use**

For this assignment, I utilized secure coding guidelines, checksum algorithms, and tools such as vulnerability scanners and encryption libraries. These resources, alongside secure coding practices, proved invaluable and will be essential in future projects to build secure, reliable applications.

**Examples for Future Employers**

This project demonstrated my skills in secure software development, vulnerability assessment, and mitigation techniques, as well as my ability to deliver production-ready code. I would showcase this assignment as a comprehensive example of identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities to create a more secure application.
